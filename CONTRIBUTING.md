# How to contribute

Here are some simple guidelines in order to make pull requests easier to merge, I will add more information in this file.

### Coding and naming convention
- Try to follow [Microsoft's convention](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/coding-conventions)
- For WPF's XAML controls and such, use PascalCase followed by the entire name of the Control used. I'm not entirely sure this is perfect, don't hesitate to comment on this.

### Git convention
- Try to use [Git Flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) in order to keep the master branch as clean as possible.
- When you want to add a new feature, create a feature branch from develop and make a pull request for that branch.
